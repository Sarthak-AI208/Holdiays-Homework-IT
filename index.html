                    In our daily life, we study and see that new technology is emerging day by day. The level of thinking had changed. Our scientists have made several unique things.

                    Few of them are related to our intelligence. Now we see that automatic machines, robots, satellites and our smartphones all are examples of artificial intelligence.

                    In the least complex terms, Artificial Intelligence implies building up the capacity to think and comprehend and settle on choices in a machine. Man-made reasoning is viewed as the most progressive type of software engineering, and it makes a brain where the PC cerebrum can think like people.

                <h4><kbd>What is AI</kbd></h4>
            </center>
            <hr>
            <p> Artificial intelligence (AI), the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. The term is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess—with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.


                All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow, and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp’s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced. Intelligence—conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex—must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.

                Psychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities. Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language.

                Learning
                There are a number of different forms of learning as applied to artificial intelligence. The simplest is learning by trial and error. For example, a simple computer program for solving mate-in-one chess problems might try moves at random until mate is found. The program might then store the solution with the position so that the next time the computer encountered the same position it would recall the solution. This simple memorizing of individual items and procedures—known as rote learning—is relatively easy to implement on a computer. More challenging is the problem of implementing what is called generalization. Generalization involves applying past experience to analogous new situations. For example, a program that learns the past tense of regular English verbs by rote will not be able to produce the past tense of a word such as jump unless it previously had been presented with jumped, whereas a program that is able to generalize can learn the “add ed” rule and so form the past tense of jump based on experience with similar verbs.

                Reasoning
                To reason is to draw inferences appropriate to the situation. Inferences are classified as either deductive or inductive. An example of the former is, “Fred must be in either the museum or the café. He is not in the café; therefore he is in the museum,” and of the latter, “Previous accidents of this sort were caused by instrument failure; therefore this accident was caused by instrument failure.” The most significant difference between these forms of reasoning is that in the deductive case the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion, whereas in the inductive case the truth of the premise lends support to the conclusion without giving absolute assurance. Inductive reasoning is common in science, where data are collected and tentative models are developed to describe and predict future behaviour—until the appearance of anomalous data forces the model to be revised. Deductive reasoning is common in mathematics and logic, where elaborate structures of irrefutable theorems are built up from a small set of basic axioms and rules.

                There has been considerable success in programming computers to draw inferences, especially deductive inferences. However, true reasoning involves more than just drawing inferences; it involves drawing inferences relevant to the solution of the particular task or situation. This is one of the hardest problems confronting AI.

        <hr>
        <p> Maturation of Artificial Intelligence (1943-1952)
            Year 1943: The first work which is now recognized as AI was done by Warren McCulloch and Walter pits in 1943. They proposed a model of artificial neurons.
            Year 1949: Donald Hebb demonstrated an updating rule for modifying the connection strength between neurons. His rule is now called Hebbian learning.
            Year 1950: The Alan Turing who was an English mathematician and pioneered Machine learning in 1950. Alan Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" in which he proposed a test. The test can check the machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to human intelligence, called a Turing test.
            <br><br>
            The birth of Artificial Intelligence (1952-1956)
            Year 1955: An Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon created the "first artificial intelligence program"Which was named as "Logic Theorist". This program had proved 38 of 52 Mathematics theorems, and find new and more elegant proofs for some theorems.
            Year 1956: The word "Artificial Intelligence" first adopted by American Computer scientist John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference. For the first time, AI coined as an academic field.
            At that time high-level computer languages such as FORTRAN, LISP, or COBOL were invented. And the enthusiasm for AI was very high at that time.
            <br><br>
            The golden years-Early enthusiasm (1956-1974)
            Year 1966: The researchers emphasized developing algorithms which can solve mathematical problems. Joseph Weizenbaum created the first chatbot in 1966, which was named as ELIZA.
            Year 1972: The first intelligent humanoid robot was built in Japan which was named as WABOT-1.
            <br><br>
            The first AI winter (1974-1980)
            The duration between years 1974 to 1980 was the first AI winter duration. AI winter refers to the time period where computer scientist dealt with a severe shortage of funding from government for AI researches.
            During AI winters, an interest of publicity on artificial intelligence was decreased.
            <br><br>
            A boom of AI (1980-1987)
            Year 1980: After AI winter duration, AI came back with "Expert System". Expert systems were programmed that emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert.
            In the Year 1980, the first national conference of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence was held at Stanford University.
            <br><br>
            The second AI winter (1987-1993)
            The duration between the years 1987 to 1993 was the second AI Winter duration.
            Again Investors and government stopped in funding for AI research as due to high cost but not efficient result. The expert system such as XCON was very cost effective.
            The emergence of intelligent agents (1993-2011)
            <br><br>
            Year 1997: In the year 1997, IBM Deep Blue beats world chess champion, Gary Kasparov, and became the first computer to beat a world chess champion.
            <br><br>
            Year 2002: for the first time, AI entered the home in the form of Roomba, a vacuum cleaner
            . <br><br>
            Year 2006: AI came in the Business world till the year 2006. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix also started using AI.
            Deep learning, big data and artificial general intelligence (2011-present)
            <br><br>
            Year 2011: In the year 2011, IBM's Watson won jeopardy, a quiz show, where it had to solve the complex questions as well as riddles. Watson had proved that it could understand natural language and can solve tricky questions quickly.
            <br><br>
            Year 2012: Google has launched an Android app feature "Google now", which was able to provide information to the user as a prediction
            . <br><br>
            Year 2014: In the year 2014, Chatbot "Eugene Goostman" won a competition in the infamous "Turing test."
            <br><br>
            Year 2018: The "Project Debater" from IBM debated on complex topics with two master debaters and also performed extremely well.
            <br><br>
            Google has demonstrated an AI program "Duplex" which was a virtual assistant and which had taken hairdresser appointment on call, and lady on other side didn't notice that she was talking with the machine.

            <h4><kbd>Advantages</kbd></h4>
        </center>
        <hr>
        <p> 1) Reduction in Human Error:
            The phrase “human error” was born because humans make mistakes from time to time. Computers, however, do not make these mistakes if they are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.
            Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.<br><br>
            2) Takes risks instead of Humans:
            This is one of the biggest advantages of Artificial intelligence. We can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI Robot which in turn can do the risky things for us. Let it be going to mars, defuse a bomb, explore the deepest parts of oceans, mining for coal and oil, it can be used effectively in any kind of natural or man-made disasters.
            Example: Have you heard about the Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in Ukraine? At that time there were no AI-powered robots that can help us to minimize the effect of radiation by controlling the fire in early stages, as any human went close to the core was dead in a matter of minutes. They eventually poured sand and boron from helicopters from a mere distance.
            AI Robots can be used in such situations where intervention can be hazardous.Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.<br><br>

            3) Available 24x7:
            An Average human will work for 4–6 hours a day excluding the breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time out for refreshing themselves and get ready for a new day of work and they even have weekly offed to stay intact with their work-life and personal life. But using AI we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored, unlike humans.
            Example: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI.Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.<br><br>

            4) Helping in Repetitive Jobs:
            In our day-to-day work, we will be performing many repetitive works like sending a thanking mail, verifying certain documents for errors and many more things. Using artificial intelligence we can productively automate these mundane tasks and can even remove “boring” tasks for humans and free them up to be increasingly creative.
            Example: In banks, we often see many verifications of documents to get a loan which is a repetitive task for the owner of the bank. Using AI Cognitive Automation the owner can speed up the process of verifying the documents by which both the customers and the owner will be benefited.Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.<br><br>

            5) Digital Assistance:
            Some of the highly advanced organizations use digital assistants to interact with users which saves the need for human resources. The digital assistants also used in many websites to provide things that users want. We can chat with them about what we are looking for. Some chatbots are designed in such a way that it’s become hard to determine that we’re chatting with a chatbot or a human being.
            Example: We all know that organizations have a customer support team that needs to clarify the doubts and queries of the customers. Using AI the organizations can set up a Voice bot or Chatbot which can help customers with all their queries. We can see many organizations already started using them on their websites and mobile applications.Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.<br><br>

            6) Faster Decisions:
            Using AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker. While taking a decision human will analyze many factors both emotionally and practically but AI-powered machine works on what it is programmed and delivers the results in a faster way.
            Example: We all have played Chess games in Windows. It is nearly impossible to beat CPU in the hard mode because of the AI behind that game. It will take the best possible step in a very short time according to the algorithms used behind it.Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.<br><br>

            7) Daily Applications:
            Daily applications such as Apple’s Siri, Window’s Cortana, Google’s OK Google are frequently used in our daily routine whether it is for searching a location, taking a selfie, making a phone call, replying to a mail and many more.
            Example: Around 20 years ago, when we are planning to go somewhere we used to ask a person who already went there for the directions. But now all we have to do is say “OK Google where is Visakhapatnam”. It will show you Visakhapatnam’s location on google map and the best path between you and Visakhapatnam.Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.<br><br>

            8) New Inventions:
            AI is powering many inventions in almost every domain which will help humans solve the majority of complex problems.
            Example: Recently doctors can predict breast cancer in the woman at earlier stages using advanced AI-based technologies.
            As every bright side has a darker version in it. Artificial Intelligence also has some disadvantages. Let’s see some of them. </p>

            <h4><kbd>Disadvantages</kbd></h4>
        </center>

        <hr>

        <p> 1. Computing Power
            The amount of power these power-hungry algorithms use is a factor keeping most developers away. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are the stepping stones of this Artificial Intelligence, and they demand an ever-increasing number of cores and GPUs to work efficiently. There are various domains where we have ideas and knowledge to implement deep learning frameworks such as asteroid tracking, healthcare deployment, tracing of cosmic bodies, and much more.

            They require a supercomputer’s computing power, and yes, supercomputers aren’t cheap. Although, due to the availability of Cloud Computing and parallel processing systems developers work on AI systems more effectively, they come at a price. Not everyone can afford that with an increase in the inflow of unprecedented amounts of data and rapidly increasing complex algorithms.

            <br><br>

            2. Trust Deficit
            One of the most important factors that are a cause of worry for the AI is the unknown nature of how deep learning models predict the output. How a specific set of inputs can devise a solution for different kinds of problems is difficult to understand for a layman.

            Many people in the world don’t even know the use or existence of Artificial Intelligence, and how it is integrated into everyday items they interact with such as smartphones, Smart TVs, Banking, and even cars (at some level of automation).
            <br><br>
            3. Limited Knowledge
            Although there are many places in the market where we can use Artificial Intelligence as a better alternative to the traditional systems. The real problem is the knowledge of Artificial Intelligence. Apart from technology enthusiasts, college students, and researchers, there are only a limited number of people who are aware of the potential of AI.

            For example, there are many SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) which can have their work scheduled or learn innovative ways to increase their production, manage resources, sell and manage products online, learn and understand consumer behavior and react to the market effectively and efficiently. They are also not aware of service providers such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services, and others in the tech industry.
            <br><br>
            4. Human-level
            This is one of the most important challenges in AI, one that has kept researchers on edge for AI services in companies and start-ups. These companies might be boasting of above 90% accuracy, but humans can do better in all of these scenarios. For example, let our model predict whether the image is of a dog or a cat. The human can predict the correct output nearly every time, mopping up a stunning accuracy of above 99%.

            For a deep learning model to perform a similar performance would require unprecedented finetuning, hyperparameter optimization, large dataset, and a well-defined and accurate algorithm, along with robust computing power, uninterrupted training on train data and testing on test data. That sounds a lot of work, and it’s actually a hundred times more difficult than it sounds.

            One way you can avoid doing all the hard work is just by using a service provider, for they can train specific deep learning models using pre-trained models. They are trained on millions of images and are fine-tuned for maximum accuracy, but the real problem is that they continue to show errors and would really struggle to reach human-level performance.

            <br><br>

            5. Data Privacy and Security
            The main factor on which all the deep and machine learning models are based on is the availability of data and resources to train them. Yes, we have data, but as this data is generated from millions of users around the globe, there are chances this data can be used for bad purposes.
            <br><br>

            For example, let us suppose a medical service provider offers services to 1 million people in a city, and due to a cyber-attack, the personal data of all the one million users fall in the hands of everyone on the dark web. This data includes data about diseases, health problems, medical history, and much more. To make matters worse, we are now dealing with planet size data. With this much information pouring in from all directions, there would surely be some cases of data leakage.

            Some companies have already started working innovatively to bypass these barriers. It trains the data on smart devices, and hence it is not sent back to the servers, only the trained model is sent back to the organization.

            <br><br>

            6. The Bias Problem
            The good or bad nature of an AI system really depends on the amount of data they are trained on. Hence, the ability to gain good data is the solution to good AI systems in the future. But, in reality, the everyday data the organizations collect is poor and holds no significance of its own.

            They are biased, and only somehow define the nature and specifications of a limited number of people with common interests based on religion, ethnicity, gender, community, and other racial biases. The real change can be brought only by defining some algorithms that can efficiently track these problems.

            <br><br>
            7. Data Scarcity
            With major companies such as Google, Facebook, and Apple facing charges regarding unethical use of user data generated, various countries such as India are using stringent IT rules to restrict the flow. Thus, these companies now face the problem of using local data for developing applications for the world, and that would result in bias.

            The data is a very important aspect of AI, and labeled data is used to train machines to learn and make predictions. Some companies are trying to innovate new methodologies and are focused on creating AI models that can give accurate results despite the scarcity of data. With biased information, the entire system could become flawed.
